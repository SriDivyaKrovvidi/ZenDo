# ZenDo — Minimal, Calm To-Do Lists (Tabs + Subtasks)

ZenDo is a clean, mobile-friendly to-do app you can open directly in a browser.  
It follows a **pastel, list-maker style** with **system light/dark mode**, lets you **brain-dump quickly**, then **organize with drag-and-drop**, add **subtasks**, **color-tag** items, and **persist locally** via `localStorage`. No backend required.

> Perfect for daily lists, project buckets, and quick planning — zero setup, zero logins.
